  # Since popular companies optimize for SEO, it made sense to use Google's Search API.
  # Although, Clearbit's API is more suited for the job, it depended on if Clearbit
  # had a record of the company in their database.
  #
  # Google Search API provides 100 search queries per day for free, so we fallback
  # to Clearbit's Autocomplete API which doesn't require any keys and is not heavily
  # throttled.
  # We are using Google's Custom Search API v7 with the tweak of searching the entire web.
  #
  # cx => Custom search ID
  # safe => Safe search moderation
  # num => number of results to fetch

  # We have chosen 7 as the default number of results to fetch from the API
  # because in some cases News articles take precedence when the brand name is colloquial.
  # We usually return the first link but in those rare cases, we have to parse through
  # first few items before we stumble upon the correct domain.
