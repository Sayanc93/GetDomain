`./get_domain.rb from_company_name Guru Microsoft -c startups saas ` yields both companies with similarity index based on the common categories provided.
However, if you want different category search for each company name. Use the file input.
First argument `company-name` and rest of the arguments can be `categories`. Check companies.txt for example.
